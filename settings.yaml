# printer_url: IP of printer. If spaghettificator is running locally, this variable should remain empty.

# photos_url: URL of webcam's snapshot action. This URL is found in mainsail settings: settings->webcams->URL->edit->URL Snapshot

# classification_settings: those variables are used to manage the process of photo classification. Algorithm works in two modes: detecting and ensuring mode.
# During detecting mode, spaghettificator is doing detections rarely. When spaghetti is detected, algorithm changes to work in ensuring mode.

# cls_detecting_gap: 30 - time between classification of images, measured in seconds
# cls_sensitivity: .8 - threshold between changing from detecting to ensuring mode

# cls_ensuring_gap: 5 - time between classification of images during ensuring mode
# cls_ensuring_ncomp: 10 - amount of photos taken during ensuring mode
# cls_ensuring_sensitivity: .95 - if this threshold is met during ensuring mode, the gcode macro is launched
# spaghetti_detected_gcode: name of gcode macro to run when spaghetti was ensured
